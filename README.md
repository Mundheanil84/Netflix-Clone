# Features of the Netflix Clone
Movie and TV Show Data:
The project uses the TMDB API to fetch movie and TV show data. It displays a collection of popular movies and TV shows on the homepage, and users can search for specific titles using the search bar. Additionally, the YouTube Search API is used to fetch and display trailers for the selected movies or TV shows.

User-Friendly Interface:
The interface is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate. The layout mimics the look and feel of Netflix, making it intuitive for users to browse through content. The use of hover effects, smooth transitions, and minimalistic design elements enhances the overall user experience.

Responsive Design:
The Netflix clone is built with a responsive design approach, ensuring it works seamlessly across all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS media queries are used to adapt the layout, font sizes, and image scales to different screen sizes.

API Integration:
The project showcases skills in API integration by using the TMDB API to fetch movie and TV show data, such as titles, descriptions, posters, and ratings. It also integrates the YouTube Search API to fetch trailers based on the selected titles, demonstrating how to work with external data sources.

Front-End Development:
The clone is built using core front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). HTML forms the backbone of the structure, CSS adds style and layout, and JavaScript brings interactivity by dynamically fetching data from the APIs and rendering it on the web page.

Project Management:
The project is managed using version control (Git) to keep track of changes, ensure proper organization, and maintain a clean codebase. Best practices for file organization, code formatting, and documentation are followed to ensure the project is easy to understand and extend.
